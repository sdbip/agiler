- Publish to Heroku. Or somewhere else?
- Design a reporter for Web Test Runner?
- Poll for events instead of pushing to Items table
  - Find new events by `position` > last processed
- Add back `task/` with a different implementation?
    “What are the available tasks that I could do right now?”
- No test fails if the client uses the wrong endpoints
- Why do some imports need `.js`?
  - Sure: imports in run.js need them, but what about others. Only sometimes...
  - There is an ESLint rule for enforcing file-extensions, but the resolver throws a fit
    just from adding `plugin:import/recommended` ("eslint-plugin-import": "^2.26.0")

- Create a proper sync function
  - Update database by polling
  - Or maintain a complete state in memory
- Allow story title to be changed
- Prioritise stories
- Add story details
- Add text describing the purpose of a story
- Add text describing the purpose of a task
- Describe the purpose of a task (simple TODO item, done by an individual or a pair/mob)

- Use Quixote to test CSS?
- Use SCSS?
- Build my own assertion library using domain language
- Stories in task list
  - Redesign promote-button
    - Add new outlined button like the disclosure-button
    - with separate “chevron”?
  - A bug made the asterisk appear next to the name after promotion.
    Should it be kept like that?
