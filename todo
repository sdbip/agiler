# Features
+ Tasks (simple todos, engineering tasks, decisions to be made, seeking external help...)
+ Stories (business value, show progress to a stakeholder)
* Features (business goals, marketable/testable/usable/lovable)
- Objectives and goals?
- Higher purpose of the product? Vision?
- Unformed ideas/Ice box

- Let tasks depend on other tasks
- Assign developers to tasks (we don't have developers yet)
- Prioritise features and stories
- Use socket.io to remove finished tasks automatically

# Stories
* New page thing for collecting features
  - Instructions that describe the purpose of stories
- Select the current feature
  - Make the current feature the focus to adding stories and tasks
- Split large feature

# Tasks
- The index.html "env" script is wrong!
- Add backend endpoints for features and adding stories to them
  - Make `Feature` a separate entity?
  - Maybe stories and tasks can remain as they are, except in the context of a feature?
- Serve copy-text using markdown
- Add a frontend path that serves the features page
- Delete the spike

# Ice Box
- Build my own assertion library using domain language
- Stories in task list
  - Remove promote-buttons from child tasks
  - Redesign promote-button
    - Add new outlined button like the disclosure-button
    - with separate “chevron”?
  - A bug made the asterisk appear next to the name after promotion.
    Should it be kept like that?
