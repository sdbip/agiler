# Tasks

# Ice Box
- move frontend.ts to a different folder.
  The other code runs in the browser
- Publish to Heroku. Or somewhere else?
- Matcher/Specification pattern
- Design a reporter for Web Test Runner?
- Poll for events instead of pushing to Items table
  - Find new events by `position` > last processed
  - `Event` should be split in three versions
    - `UnpublishedEvent` with object details
    - `PublishedEvent` with stringified details
    - `Event` with entity id/type for projection
- Add back `tasks/` with a different implementation?
    “What are the available tasks that I could do right now?”
