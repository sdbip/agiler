# Features
+ Tasks (simple todos, engineering tasks, decisions to be made, seeking external help...)
+ Stories (business value, show progress to a stakeholder)
- Features (business goals, marketable/testable/usable/lovable)
  - Upgrade Story to Feature
  - Split Feature
- Objectives and goals?
- Higher purpose of the product? Vision?
- Unformed ideas/Ice box

- Let tasks depend on other tasks
- Assign developers to tasks (we don't have developers yet)
- Prioritise features and stories
- Use socket.io to remove finished tasks automatically

# Stories
- Remove promote-buttons from child tasks
- Redesign promote-button
  - Add new outlined button like the disclosure-button
  - with separate “chevron”?
- A bug made the asterisk appear next to the name after promotion.
  Should it be kept like that?

# Tasks
* Migrate to MVC pattern
  - Controller receives UI events and updates model
  - Model emits events when their data is updated
  - View only reads model data (and events) to display the stuff
- Some tests are turned off. Reenable them according to the new paradigm

# Ice Box
