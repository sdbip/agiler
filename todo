# Features

* Stories (business value, show progress to a stakeholder)
- Features (business goals, marketable/testable/usable/lovable)
- Objectives and goals?

# Tasks
* Refactor to CQRS/ES
  - try/catch in `PGEventPublisher` not tested (should it work like that anyway?)
  - Need `version` to order events
    - Version is always 0
  - Check for concurrent version changes
  - Replace constructor params with (id, version)
  - Position is always 0; set the same position for all events added at the same time
  - Set actor & timestamp

# Ice Box
- move frontend.ts to a different folder.
  The other code runs in the browser
- Publish to Heroku. Or somewhere else?
- Matcher/Specification pattern
- Design a reporter for Web Test Runner?
- Poll for new events
  - Find new events by `position` > last processed
  - `Event` should be split in three versions
    - `UnpublishedEvent` with object details
    - `PublishedEvent` with stringified details
    - `Event` with entity id/type for projection
