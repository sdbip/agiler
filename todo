# Features
+ Tasks (simple todos, engineering tasks, decisions to be made, seeking external help...)
+ Stories (business value, show progress to a stakeholder)
+ Features (business goals, marketable/testable/usable/lovable)
- Objectives and goals?
- Higher purpose of the product? Vision?
- Unformed ideas/Ice box

- Allow changing item title
- Add a description/subtitle?
- Let tasks depend on other tasks
- Assign developers to tasks (we don't have developers yet)
  - And be listed in the UI in that order
  - It should be possible to drag/drop to change the order
- Use socket.io to remove finished tasks automatically

# Stories
- Items should have a prioritisation order
- Select the current feature
  - Make the current feature the focus to adding stories and tasks

# Tasks
- Change `.item-<type>` to `.item.<type>`?
- Apply eventual consistency
  - Complete task
  - Promote task
- Split `TaskComponent` and `StoryComponent` in two
- Split `MMFComponent` and `FeatureComponent` in two
- Remove duplication in index vs features
- Test `FeatureComponent`
- Rename the `ItemCache`?

# Ice Box
- Use Quixote to test CSS?
- Use SCSS?
- Build my own assertion library using domain language
- Stories in task list
  - Remove promote-buttons from child tasks
  - Redesign promote-button
    - Add new outlined button like the disclosure-button
    - with separate “chevron”?
  - A bug made the asterisk appear next to the name after promotion.
    Should it be kept like that?
