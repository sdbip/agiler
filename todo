# Features
+ Tasks (simple todos, engineering tasks, decisions to be made, seeking external help...)
+ Stories (business value, show progress to a stakeholder)
* Features (business goals, marketable/testable/usable/lovable)
- Objectives and goals?
- Higher purpose of the product? Vision?
- Unformed ideas/Ice box

- Let tasks depend on other tasks
- Assign developers to tasks (we don't have developers yet)
- Prioritise features and stories
- Use socket.io to remove finished tasks automatically

# Stories
* New page thing for collecting features
- Select the current feature
  - Make the current feature the focus to adding stories and tasks

# Tasks
- Add components to the features context
  - `FeatureComponent`
  - `PageComponent`
  - `TaskComponent`
- Split `TaskComponent` and `StoryComponent` in two

# Ice Box
- Build my own assertion library using domain language
- Stories in task list
  - Remove promote-buttons from child tasks
  - Redesign promote-button
    - Add new outlined button like the disclosure-button
    - with separate “chevron”?
  - A bug made the asterisk appear next to the name after promotion.
    Should it be kept like that?
