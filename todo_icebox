- Add back `task/` with a different implementation?
    “What are the available tasks that I could do right now?”
- No test fails if the client uses the wrong endpoints
- Why do some imports need `.js`?
  - Sure: imports in run.js need them, but what about others. Only sometimes...
  - There is an ESLint rule for enforcing file-extensions, but the resolver throws a fit
    just from adding `plugin:import/recommended` ("eslint-plugin-import": "^2.26.0")
