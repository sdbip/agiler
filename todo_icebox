# Ice Box
- move frontend.ts to a different folder.
  The other code runs in the browser
- Publish to Heroku. Or somewhere else?
- Matcher/Specification pattern
- Design a reporter for Web Test Runner?
- Poll for events instead of pushing to Items table
  - Find new events by `position` > last processed
- Add back `task/` with a different implementation?
    “What are the available tasks that I could do right now?”
- No test fails if the client uses the wrong endpoints
- Why do some imports need `.js`?
  - Sure: imports in run.js need them, but what about others. Only sometimes...
  - There is an ESLint rule for enforcing file-extensions, but the resolver throws a fit 
    just from adding `plugin:import/recommended` ("eslint-plugin-import": "^2.26.0")
